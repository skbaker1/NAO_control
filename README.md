# NAO_control
A way to test and save gestures for the NAO

The gifs are just for your own reference.  If you putin a degree value past the NAO's range of motion, you will get an error and nothing will happen.  Also, for now you have to close the window and open it up again if you want to see the gesture you saved.

Please let me know if you run into any bugs!
